    "content": "MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a software design pattern that separates the representation of information from the user's interaction with it. The model consists of the data and business logic, the view is the user interface, and the controller handles the input and updates the model and view accordingly."

    "posted_by": "Raquel Smith",
    "posted_on": "2024-04-04",
    "content": "PUT and POST are both HTTP methods used to send data to a server, but they have different purposes. PUT is used to update or replace an existing resource, while POST is used to create a new resource. PUT is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request, while POST is not idempotent."
